# Point-on-wave Data of EPFL-campus Distribution Network
Point-on-wave data collected on the 20 kV network of EPFL-campus.

## The experimental setup
### The electric network
The data refer to the medium voltage network illustrated in the following figure, representing a 20 kV substation of EPFL campus coupled with a battery energy storage system (BESS).

The busbar is composed of 2 line departures connecting neighbor substations, 2 MV/LV 630 kVA transformers supplying electricity to office buildings, and one cable connecting the BESS. 

### The sensing infrastructure
The waveform recorder functionality has been integrated in the PMU developed in EPFL-DESL laboratory.
The hardware platform is based on the National Instruments [compactRIO 9068](http://www.ni.com/pdf/manuals/376007a_02.pdf), an embedded industrial controller with a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor and equipped with a customized Linux-RT OS, a user-programmable Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Artix-7 equipped with a 40 MHz free-running clock and reconfigurable IO modules. 
The device has been equipped with:
* A stationary GPS unit [NI-9467](http://www.ni.com/datasheet/pdf/en/ds-537) for the synchronization to UTC-time, accurate to within +- 100 ns. The GPS antenna is mounted on the rooftop of DESL laboratory with a full-sky visibility and is coupled to the module via a 30-meters RG-213 shielded cable (GPS coordinates 46.51834 latitude, 6.56522 longitude);
* Two analog input modules [NI-9215](http://www.ni.com/pdf/manuals/373779a_02.pdf) characterized by an input range of +- 10 V and a sampling frequency of 50 kHz.

The medium voltage signals are acquired by dedicated instrument transformer manufactured by Altea Solutions. Specifically, [CS-50-I](http://www.alteasolutions.com/pdf/Datasheet%20CS-50-I%20Altea) current class 0.2 and [VS-24-C](http://www.alteasolutions.com/pdf/Technical%20Specifications%20VS-24-C.pdf) voltage class 0.5 sensor.

### The battery storage system
The variations in current magnitude shown in the data have been generated by a 560 kWh/720 kVA BESS. Such BESS is composed by Lithium titanate oxide (LTO) cells arranged in series and parallel to form 9 battery racks connected to a DC bus whose voltage oscillates between 590 and 810 V. The DC bus is interfaced with the medium-voltage grid through a four quadrant DC-AC converter and a 0.3/21 kV, 630 kVA transformer. 

The power injection of the BESS is controlled by requesting active and reactive power setpoints to the converter. Such requests are sent to the converter controller from a desktop computer connected on the same subnet through the ModBUS TCP protocol.

## Data
The waveforms enclosed to this report have been obtained by, in rapid sequence, (i) starting the recording and (ii) imposing a step in the active power injection of the BESS.
The data cover 5 events:
* BESS idle;
* step in BESS power from 0 to 500 kW;
* step in BESS power from 0 to -500 kW;
* step in BESS power from 0 to 200 kW;
* step in BESS power from 0 to -200 kW;
* step in BESS power from -500 to 500 kW.

Note that we apply an *active sign convention*. That is, a positive BESS active power corresponds to the BESS discharging/injecting power into the grid. For each event, the following quantities are reported:
* three-phase voltages at the busbar (V1, V2, V3);
* 2 x three-phase line currents absorbed by two transformers (ia1, ia2, ia3 and ib1, ib2, ib3).
* three-phase line currents absorbed by the BESS transformer (ic1, ic2, ic3);

Such quantities are stored with 20 Î¼s sampling time and for a duration of 2 seconds.
The measures should be scaled with an amplification gain of 3500 for the voltage, 3.1 for the current absorbed by the BESS and 1 for those by the two transformers. 

### Data format
5 Matlab structure variables are provided, each containing data from one of the considered events:
* BESS_idle.mat;
* BESS_0_to_p500.mat;
* BESS_0_to_m500.mat;
* BESS_0_to_p200.mat;
* BESS_0_to_m200.mat;
* BESS_m500_to_p500.mat. 
Each structure has 12 fields, corresponding to the 12 quantities listed above. Each field is a column array containing the respective data. The names of the structures and fields are self-explanatory.
